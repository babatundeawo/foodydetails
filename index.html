		<h2>WHAT IS FOOD</h2>
		<p>Food is anything intended to supply energy or nourishment to the body. It is any
			substance consumed by living
			organisms to provide nutritional support.It is usually of plant or
			animal origin, and it contains essential
			nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals.
			The foods and beverages you eat and drink supply your body with the
			basic nutrients you need to support your
			health on a daily basis. Some of these food components must undergo
			digestion before you can benefit from
			them, although not all food component undergo digestion. All together
			these nutrients (water, protein, fat,
			carbohydrate, minerals and vitamins) promote your health
			when you consume them regularly through your diet. Remember humans are
			omnivorous animals that can consume
			both plant and animal products.</p>

		<p>However, food is needed to repair and replace body tissues, build healthy body,
			supply energy for the
			body,maintain body temperature and build new cells, maintain life, or
			stimulate growth. Another way to categorise food is by the type of
			nutrient it contains and its role in the body. A nutrient is
			a compound your body needs for energy, growth, basic physiological
			processes and your overall health. Also
			nutrient is a source of nourishment such as food that can be metabolised
			by an organism to give energy and
			build tissue.</p>
		<p><img src="img/food3.jpg" alt="food1"></p>
		<p>Nutrient is further divided into three categories which are plant Nutrient, animal
			Nutrient and plant and
			animal nutrient mixed together. The first class of the nutrient is
			‘Rich’, the second class of the nutrient
			is poor, while the third class is regarded as nutrient barren and they
			all serve different purposes in the
			body.</p>

		<h2>FOOD NUTRIENTS</h2>
		<p><img src="img/food2.jpg" alt="food2"></p>
		<h3><a name="first"></a>FIRST CLASS, NUTRIENT-RICH</h3>
		<P>These are plant foods that are rich in virtually all of the nutrients your body needs
			to function, stay
			healthy and perform well. They also have fiber and phytochemicals, and
			they do not contain substances your
			body does not need. It is recommended that you maintain a diet that is
			made up of at least 90% or More Plant-Based, Nutrient-Rich
			foods, meals, and menus for the best all-around results. Examples of
			these super-foods include:</P>
		<ul>
			<li>Vegetables</li>
			<li>Fruits</li>
			<li>Legumes (beans)</li>
			<li>Raw Nuts and Seeds</li>
			<li>Whole, unrefined grains</li>
		</ul>
		<h3><a name="second"></a>SECOND-CLASS, NUTRIENT-POOR</h3>
		<P>These are animal-based foods that are rich in some nutrients but are missing whole
			categories of others. They
			also contain substances like cholesterol and saturated fat that the body
			does not need from dietary sources. It is recommended that you maintain
			a diet that includes no more than 10% animal foods if you decide to eat
			them at all. Examples of these foods include:
		</P>
		<ul>
			<li>Fish</li>
			<li>Low Fat Dairy</li>
			<li>Full-fat Dairy</li>
			<li>Chicken and Beef</li>
			<li>Eggs</li>
		</ul>
		<h3> <a name="third"></a> THIRD-CLASS, NUTRIENT-BARREN</h3>
		<P>These are foodstuffs of both plant and animal origin that have been refined and
			stripped of their nutrients.
			While some are added back in for nutritional and marketing purposes,
			most of the ingredients are highly
			concentrated pleasure-stimulating substances that addict you, while
			making you fat and sick. It is recommended that you eat these foodstuffs
			rarely or avoid them all together. Examples of these foods
			include:</P>
		<ul>
			<li>Refined grains</li>
			<li>Refined Oil and Sweets</li>
		</ul>
