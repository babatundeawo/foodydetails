        One molecule of fat is usually made of several fatty acids. These fatty acids are made of long chains of carbon and
        hydrogen atoms. All fats can be divided into unsaturated and saturated. Saturated fats are the ones where all carbon
        atoms are bonded to hydrogen atoms. Unsaturated fats are the ones where carbon is usually connected with double bonds
        with a few molecules of hydrogen. Fats are used to regulating energy, be a source of energy, help with temperature regulation and vitamin absorption. Fats
        can be food in various foods, like dairy products, meat, fish, whole eggs, vegetables, nuts and so on.
